### Will Netflix kill TV?

The power of TV has been dwindling over recent years. It is no longer something that unites a nation, it’s not something we do as a collective anymore. Timeshifting, VCRs, DVRs and streaming make watching on demand possible and, by handing us the remote, perhaps a more desirable experience. Netflix’s arrival to Australian shores has had a massive effect on our viewing habits - and the experience of Netflix is fundamentally different to TV. It’s on demand, all available, ad free and cheap - so will it kill TV?
